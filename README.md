Ctrl-Adapter is an efficient and versatile framework for adding diverse
spatial controls to any image or video diffusion model. It supports a variety of useful
applications, including video control, video control with multiple conditions, video control with
sparse frame conditions, image control, zero-shot transfer to unseen conditions, and video editing.







# üìù TODO List

- [ ] Release environment setup, inference code, and model checkpoints. (**WIP**)
- [ ] Release training code, and guidline to adapt our Ctrl-Adapter to new image/video diffusion models. 
- [ ] Release evaluation code.

üíó Please let us know in the issues or PRs if you're interested in any relevant backbones or down-stream tasks that can be implemented by our Ctrl-Adapter framework!
